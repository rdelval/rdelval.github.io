				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many old computers (pre Vista era) have no support for booting from a USB drive.</p>
<p>This became an issue the moment Linux distros were only made to be installed from a DVD drive. That&#8217;s because most of the computers that don&#8217;t have support for booting from a USB also don&#8217;t have DVD drives.</p>
<p>This meant that I was limited to installing distros that fit on a CD, such as Ubuntu minimal. This is fine for most as you can choose to install your favorite DE during the menu selection in the install process.</p>
<p>In this case, most of my lab has become very familiar with Linux Mint which we use due to its similarity to the &#8220;XP&#8221; interface so many are used to. In short, it&#8217;s much easier for new students to work with the system (not against it!) and get to work.</p>
<p>However, since around Linux Mint 14, the install image doesn&#8217;t fit on a DVD. A little searching brought me to the <a href="https://www.plop.at/en/bootmanager/download.html">Plop Boot Manager</a>. It&#8217;s a cool little project that does away with any booting inadequacies the BIOS has. It boots to a simple interface which then allows you to boot from a USB drive.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for me, it didn&#8217;t work at first. The drive containing Linux Mint 17.3 XFCE refused to boot. By chance I happened to enter the settings and tweaked them to force USB 1.1 in Mode 1. This let me finally boot into the live environment and install from the USB.</p>
